# CNN-based MNIST Classification using TensorFlow and Keras

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras to implement and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset containing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the dataset includes 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

In this project, we:
1. Preprocess the MNIST dataset for use with Keras CNN models.
2. Build and train CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras' Sequential and Functional APIs.
3. Evaluate the performance of the trained models on the test dataset.

## Files in the Project

- **`592ML-tf-keras-cnn.ipynb`**: The main script for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, defining the CNN models, training, and evaluating their performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `592ML-tf-keras-cnn.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file to execute the code step-by-step.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Load the MNIST dataset using `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.
- Normalize pixel values to the range `[0, 1]`.
- Expand dimensions of images to shape `(28, 28, 1)` to match CNN input requirements.

### 2. Building CNN Models
Two CNN architectures are implemented:
- **Functional API Model**:
  - Input layer: `(28, 28, 1)`
  - Conv2D: 32 filters, kernel size `(3, 3)`, ReLU activation.
  - MaxPooling: Pool size `(2, 2)`, stride `(2, 2)`.
  - Flatten layer.
  - Dense output layer: 10 units with Softmax activation.
  
- **Sequential API Model**:
  - Similar architecture as above but built using Keras' Sequential API.

### 3. Model Training
- Compile the models with:
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
  - Metric: Accuracy
- Train the models for 2 epochs using the MNIST training data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Predict digit labels for sample test images.
- Evaluate model accuracy using the test dataset.

## Example Output

After training for 2 epochs:
- Functional API Model Accuracy: ~93%
- Sequential API Model Accuracy: ~93%

## Sample Code Snippets

### Building a CNN using Functional API
```python
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
c = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='valid', activation='relu')(inputs)
m = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), (2, 2))(c)
f = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(m)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(f)

model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

### Training the Model
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

### Making Predictions
```python
predicted = model(x_test[0:1, :])
print(tf.math.argmax(predicted[0]).numpy())
```

## Results

- The models achieved over 93% accuracy after 2 epochs of training.
- Predictions for sample images were consistent with their true labels.

## Future Work

- Increase the number of epochs for better accuracy.
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Implement data augmentation for more robust training.
